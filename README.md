# Prosper Loan Data Analysis
## by Fidel Kalele Wafula


## Dataset
The dataset comprises of 113,937 observations of loans with 81 features. These are loans applied by Prosper Market place customers from 2009 to 2014. Some of the features include loan status, borrower Annual Percentage Rate (APR), borrower interest rate, loan term, employment status and Prosper rating among others.

## Summary of Findings

The following are concluded from the Proper Loan Data analysis:

**1. Effects of the Prosper Loan Credit Ratings:**

Majority of the loans are under the rating of 'C' with the least number in 'HR' category. There seems to be a negative correlation between Prosper rating and the borrower APR. Loans with the best ratings (AA, A) having the least APR, whereas the loans with bad ratings (E, HR) have the most APR. This acts as a balance control to reward the best loan customers while motivating the high risk customers. Furthermore, loans that are rated as high risk (HR) have higher interest rate. The borrower rate decreases as the loan rating moves to lower risk categories. This implies a positive relationship between risk level and the borrower rate.

**2. Interaction of Borrower Rate and other features:**

The borrower rate generally is lower for best rated loans while it increases as the loan ratings deteriorates. Across most of the rating categories, borrower rate increases with the increasing loan term, except for worst rating (HR) whose only term is medium term (36 months). The borrower rate for non-home owners has always been higher than for the home owners since 2009. Generally, the spread of these rates for both categories has been declining with time. Also, the borrower rates have reduced significantly after 2012. Loans that are rated as high risk (HR) have higher interest rate. The borrower rate decreases as the loan rating moves to lower risk categories. This implies a positive relationship between risk level and the borrower rate.

**3. Loan Book Performance:**

Loan applications for the purpose of debt consolidation are the most popular. Other reasons for loan applications include 'other', home improvement and business, decreasing in that order. Also, a customer rarely fails to specify the loan reason. The least popular reasons include student use, engagement ring and baby & adoption. Generally, most applications are made at the beginning of the year with the counts reducing towards April, when it's the lowest. Thereafter, the number of applications pick up incrementally up to the end of the year. Highest numbers of applications have been realized in the months of January and October. Also, The majority of the loans in the Prosper's loan book are paying well (i.e. either in the current status or completed status). Additionally, medium term loans are the most preferred, followed by long term loans. Short term loans are rarely taken by the borrowers.

## Key Insights for Presentation
The analysis indicated that prosper credit rating affects borrower APR in a negative relationship. This implies that loans that are have better credit ratings are relatively cheaper as compared to those that have worse ratings. Additionally, loans with good ratings tend to have lower borrower interest rates than those that are badly rated. This further confirms the loans improved affordability with better credit ratings.

A further analysis of the interaction of the other features and the borrower interest rates indicated a positive relationship between loan terms and the rates. Also, the borrower rate for home owners has been lower in contrast to non-home owners borrowers' rates.Generally, the spread of these rates for both categories has been declining with time. Also, the borrower rates have reduced significantly after 2012. Loans that are rated as high risk (HR) have higher interest rate. The borrower rate decreases as the loan rating moves to lower risk categories. This implies a positive relationship between risk level and the borrower rate. Therefore, customers should endeavor to pay their loans diligently and consider being home owners in order to access cheaper loans.
